        The periodic table is a tabular arrangement of the chemical elements, organized by their atomic number, electron configuration, and recurring chemical properties. This systematic arrangement allows scientists to observe trends and patterns in the properties of elements.
      </p>
      <p>
        Elements are classified into periods (rows) and groups (columns). The rows represent the number of electron shells an atom possesses, while the columns group elements with similar chemical behaviors due to their shared electron configurations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dmitri Mendeleev, a Russian chemist, is credited with creating the first widely recognized periodic table in 1869. He organized elements based on their atomic mass, predicting the existence and properties of undiscovered elements.
      </p>
      <p>
        Modern periodic tables are arranged by atomic number, reflecting the periodic law, which states that elements exhibit recurring properties when arranged by atomic number.
